  abstract = {Methods for experimental reconstruction of molecular frame (MF) photoionization dynamics, and related properties{\textemdash}specifically MF photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) and continuum density matrices{\textemdash}are outlined and discussed. General concepts are introduced for the non-expert reader, and experimental and theoretical techniques are further outlined in some depth. Particular focus is placed on a detailed example of numerical reconstruction techniques for matrix-element retrieval from time-domain experimental measurements making use of rotational-wavepackets (i.e. aligned frame measurements){\textemdash}the `bootstrapping to the MF' methodology{\textemdash}and a matrix-inversion technique for direct MF-PAD recovery. Ongoing resources for interested researchers are also introduced, including sample data, reconstruction codes (the Photoelectron Metrology Toolkit, written in python, and associated Quantum Metrology with Photoelectrons platform/ecosystem), and literature via online repositories; it is hoped these resources will be of ongoing use to the community.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The overall aim of \emph{Quantum Metrology with Photoelectrons, Volume 3} is to expand, explore, and illustrate new computational developments in quantum metrology with photoelectrons: specifically, the application of new Python-based tools to tackle general problems in photoionization matrix element retrieval. Part I details the topic, theory and computational methods; Part II provides further numerical details and case-studies, specifically employing the generalised bootstrap retrieval protocol, which makes use of rotational wavepackets as a geometric control parameter. Problems of various size and difficulty are investigated, with the largest for an asymmetric top with 38 complex matrix elements (equivalently, a 38x38 density matrix retrieval).{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Key features{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}{\textbullet} Interpreting experimental data.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}{\textbullet} Extraction/reconstruction/determination of quantum mechanical properties (matrix elements, wavefunctions, density matrices) from experimental data.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}{\textbullet} Comparison of experimental and theoretical data.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}{\textbullet} New analysis methodologies and techniques.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}{\textbullet} Introduction to newly-developed software platforms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
